# scripts and tools

## A collection of small tools and stuff I wrote to make my life marginally easier

### Programs so far
* fhash - intuitive CLI for hashing files
* xls2csv - converts old excel files into a csv format without having to use Excel
* julia-c - C-based CLI for efficient julia set image rendering because python was too slow.
